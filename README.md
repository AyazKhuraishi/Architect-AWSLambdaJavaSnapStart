# Explore ways to use Java Runtimes with AWS Lambda also using different framewoks. 
# I also explore AWS SnapSart to reduce cold starts. 
# I tested different Lambda deployment package sizes, Lambda memory settings, Java compilation options and (a)synchronous HTTP clients.

# The code example include storing and retrieving product from the Amazon DynamoDB. I put Amazon API Gateway in front of my Lambdas.
# To the explored Java Runtime belong: Java 11, Java 17 and Java 21.
# To the explore frameworks belong : Micronaut, Quarkus and Spring Boot (including Spring Boot 3.2.  version)
